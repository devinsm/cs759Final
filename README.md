# Final Project for CS 759
I will be simulating heat diffusion by numerically approximating solutions to the heat equation.

## Plan
I will be using a finite difference approximation of the heat equation. Specifically
I will start by implementing a simulation of the diffusion of heat in a 1d "rod"
using the "explicit" difference equation.
