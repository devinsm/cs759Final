# Final Project for CS 759
I will be simulating heat diffusion by numerically approximating solutions to the heat equation.

### Todos
+ Make sure that numeric types are large enough to handle all relevant problems and
simulation params
+ Add check to make sure r <= 1/2. If r > 1/2 alert the user that the explicit method
can not be used for the parameters given and terminate.
+ Improve efficiency
+ Set up GNUPG and share repo with course staff
+ Make reusable/flexible animation program
+ Make sure interface the between animation program and simulation can handle very large
simulations (if you write the data to a file, how much data can the simulation output)
+ Update main to print comma separated values to file with first line t, second line points,
subsequent lines the temps

testing gpg a second time
