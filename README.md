# Final Project for CS 759
This code numerically approximates solutions to the 1D heat equation. It does so
using the [Forwards-Time Centered-Space (FTCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTCS_scheme)
method.

The simulation really consists of two parts. The first part is a CUDA program
which actually numerically approximates the solution. This CUDA program, which is
in heatEquation.hpp and main.cu, was written to run on [UW-Madison's Euler cluster](http://sbel.wisc.edu/Resources/Hardware/). It periodically writes temperatures at
discrete points along the rod to a file.

The second part is a Python script, animate.py, which is used to visualize the solution.
The script uses matplotlib, and reads the data generated by the CUDA program to
create an animation of the heat diffusing over time. The script was developed to be
run on someone's local Linux or Mac machine using Python 2.7.

The last component of this project is the Python script plotTimmings.py. It uses
matplotlib to graph the run time of the simulation versus the number of time steps
for which the simulation performed calculations.

# Building and Running

## Generating the Data on Euler
1. Clone this repository on Euler.
1. Run `make` in the top level directory of this project (that is to say the
the directory that this README is in).
1. Run `mkdir simData`
1. The generated executable is named `generate_data`. This is the CUDA program
which will be run on Euler to generate the data.
1. Run `./generate_data` either via a slurm script or in interactive mode
1. The generated data is now in a folder called `simData`
1. In order to copy this data to your local machine you will have to compress it.
1. Run `zip -r simData simData`
1. After the compression completes, there will be a file called `simData.zip`
1. Copy `simData.zip` and `animate.py` to your local machine. I
trust you already have some way you usually copy files back and forth.

IMPORTANT: Even if you use sshfs or sftpnetdrive, you will still have to manually
move the compressed file over to your local machine. You can drag and drop it if
you'd like, you can use `scp` if you'd like, but `simData.zip` needs to be on your
local machine's hard drive.

## Running The Animation
Unfortunately the animation requires matplotlib, which can't be used on Euler
at the moment. You will need to install matplotlib if you don't already have it.

#### Installing Matplotlib
The best way to install matplotlib is to install the Anaconda package manager.
1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/
2. Download the Python 2.7 version of Anaconda. This comes with everything you need.

#### Running the Animation
1. `cd` into the directory with `simData.zip` and `animate.py`
1. Unzip `simData.zip`
1. `animate.py` takes a file name as its first argument. For its second argument
you can optionally give it the time in milliseconds that the animation should pause
between frames (the default value is 200). The minimum value for the second argument is 1.
1. For each file `aFile` in the unziped `simData` run `python animate.py aFile`.
If you want to speed things up or slow them down you can run `python animate.py aFile timeStep`.
